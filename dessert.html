<h2>About The Dessert Habitat!</h2>

    Deserts are the driest places on Earth—they get fewer than 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain a year. Some deserts may get a lot
    of rain all at once. Then it might not rain again for months—or even years! Many deserts were formed 8,000 to 10,000 years ago.
    Some are superhot in the day. In fact the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth was 134°F (56.6°C) in California and Nevada's
    Death Valley in 1913. t may seem like nothing can live in a desert because it’s so dry. But most deserts are full of life, with
    plants and animals that have adapted to survive without much water. Some plants, like cacti, store enough water in their stems to
    last until the next rain.

<h3>About the Fennec Foxes!</h3>

<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/fennec-fox">
    Fennec foxes are sometimes called "desert foxes" because they live in desert zones of North Africa and the Sinai and Arabian<br>
    peninsulas. They are nocturnal and avoid the daytime heat of the desert environment. Their batlike ears radiate body heat and<br>
    help keep the foxes cool. They also have long, thick, soft fur coats with a wooly undercoat that insulates them during cold<br>
    nights and sunny days.They have been known to jump in the air 2 feet high from a standing position, and they are able to leap<br>
    a distance of 4 feet.These foxes dwell in small groups of up to ten individuals. Like dogs and other canids, male fennecs<br>
    mark their territory with urine.<br>
