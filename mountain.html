    It can be a long climb to the top of a mountain, but once you’re there, you can see for miles. It’s like you’re standing on top<br>
    of the world! Some mountains form when the big slabs of rock—called tectonic plates—that make up the Earth’s crust crash into<br>
    each other. Over millions of years, the sheets of rock push up and over one another, creating the mountain.Mountains often have<br>
    extreme climates, and the animals that live there have some amazing adaptations. For instance, the red panda in Asia’s Himalaya <br>
    grows a thick coat. Some animals' fur is more than insulation<br>

    havethe widest geographic range of any land mammal in the Western Hemisphere.In North America, mountain lions eat mainly<br>
    deer, but they also eat smaller animals, such as mice and rabbits. These cats have a poor sense of smell, but have excellent<br>
    vision and hearing that help them hunt in the early morning and evening hours.<br>

<h3>About the Grizzly Bears!</h3>
<a href="https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Mammals/Grizzly-Bear"><h5>Information from National Wildlife Federation</h5></a>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Mammals/Grizzly-Bear">
    The grizzly bear is a kind of brown bear. Many people in North America use the common name “grizzly bear” to refer to the smaller<br>
    and lighter-colored bear that occurs in interior areas.Grizzly bears once roamed throughout the entire western United States south<br>
    into Mexico, including the Great Plains and along rivers in desert habitats. Grizzly bears are omnivores. The most commonly eaten<br>
    kinds of plants are fleshy roots, fruits, berries, grasses, and forbs.Grizzly bears use sounds, movement, and smells to communicate<br>
    They growl,moan, or grunt, especially when females are communicating with their young or during mating season when male bears<br>
    can fight each other fiercely for the opportunity to mate with receptive females.<br>
