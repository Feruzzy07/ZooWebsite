    It’s frigid and you’re surrounded by ice.You wonder how any <br>
    animal could survive in this extreme cold.Then a polar bear <br>
    and her cubs lumber by, and in the ocean behind them a whale <br>
    erupts from the water.<br>

<h3>About the Emperor Penguins!</h3>
<a href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/facts/emperor-penguin" target="_blank"><h5>Information from National Geographic</h5></a>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/facts/emperor-penguin">
    Emperor penguins spend their entire lives on Antarctic ice and in its waters. They survive—breeding, raising young,<br>
    and eating—by relying on a number of clever adaptations. These flightless birds breed in the winter. After a courtship <br>
    of several weeks, a female emperor penguin lays one single egg then leaves! Each penguin egg's father balances it on his <br>
    feet and covers it with his brood pouch, a very warm layer of feathered skin designed to keep the egg cozy. There the males <br>
    stand, for about 65 days, through icy temperatures, cruel winds, and blinding storms. <br>

<h3>About the Polar Bears!</h3>
<a href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/polar-bear"><h5>Information from National Geographic</h5></a>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/polar-bear">
    Polar bears live along shores and on sea ice in the icy cold Arctic. When sea ice forms over the ocean in cold weather,<br>
    many polar bears, except pregnant females, head out onto the ice to hunt seals. olar bears roam the Arctic ice sheets and<br>
    swim in that region's coastal waters. They are very strong swimmers, and their large front paws, which they use to paddle,<br>
    are slightly webbed. Some polar bears have been seen swimming hundreds of miles from land—though they probably cover most <br>
    of that distance by floating on sheets of ice. <br>
