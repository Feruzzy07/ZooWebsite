<h2>About The Rainforest Habitat!</h2>
<a href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/rain-forest" target="_blank"><h5>Information from National Geographic</h5></a>
A beam of sunlight makes its way through the leaves and lights up the brightly colored wings of a macaw. An enormous butterfly<br>
from plant to plant. Monkeys shout and chatter as they swing from tree to tree looking for breakfast. The rainforest is waking up.<br>
Rainforests are lush, warm, wet habitats. Trees in the rainforest grow very tall because they have to compete with other plants for<br>
sunlight.The rainforest has four layers. The emergent layer is made up of the very tallest trees that rise higher than the rest of<br>
the forest.Many kinds of plants grow in rainforests. Lianas are thick, woody vines that grow up the trees.More than half of the<br>
worldâ€™s animals live in the rainforest.<br>

<h3>About the Chimpanzees  </h3>
<a href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/chimpanzee" target="_blank"><h5>Information from National Geographic</h5></a>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/chimpanzee">
    Chimpanzees are omnivores, meaning they eat both plants and animals. Young chimpanzees learn from observing their mothers and other<br>
    adults which foods are safe to eat and where ripe food is located.For the first few months of its life, a baby chimp clings to its<br>
    mother's belly as she travels with it everywhere. After that, young chimpanzees will spend the next seven to ten years at their<br>
    mothers' sides learning how to groom, make nests in trees, find food, and use tools. Although they normally walk on all fours<br>
    (knuckle-walking), chimpanzees can stand and walk upright. By swinging from branch to branch they can also move quite efficiently<br>
    in the trees, where they do most of their eating and sleeping.<br>

<h3>About the Red-Eyed Tree Frogs!</h3>

    Being green helps the red-eyed tree frog blend in with tree leaves.A female red-eyed tree frog has laid a batch of eggs on a leaf.<br>
    When the eggs are ready to hatch, the tadpoles inside start swirling around.The activity breaks each egg open, releasing the little<br>
    tadpoles. All the tadpoles wash down the leaf in a little stream of moisture from the hatching eggs, and land in the pond below.<br>
    Feeding on tiny insects, the tadpoles live in the water they fell into until they metamorphose, or develop, into little brown froglets.<br>
    Being green helps the red-eyed tree frog blend in with tree leaves. If the green camouflage fails and a predator spots a sleeping frog,<br>
    it swoops in for what it thinks will be a tasty meal.<br>
