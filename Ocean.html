<h2>About The Ocean Habitat!</h2>
<a href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/ocean" target="_blank"><h5>Information from National Geographic</h5></a>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/ocean">
    From outer space Earth looks like an awesome blue marble. That’s because most of Earth’s surface—more than 70 percent<br>
    —is covered by oceans.Oceans are areas of salty water that fill enormous basins on the Earth’s surface. Even though<br>
    Earth has one continuous body of saltwater scientists and geographers divide it into five different sections. <br>
    From biggest to smallest, they are the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian, the Southern, and the Arctic Oceans.<br>

<h3>About the Bottlenose Dolphins!</h3>
<a href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/bottlenose-dolphin" target="_blank"><h5>Information from National Geographic</h5></a>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/bottlenose-dolphin">
    Thought to be some of the smartest animals on Earth, bottlenose dolphins send messages to one another in many different ways.<br>
    Bottlenose dolphins squeak, squawk and use body language—leaping as high as 20 feet in the air, snapping their jaws, slapping <br>
    their tails on the surface of the water, blowing bubbles and even butting heads. Each dolphin has a special whistle that it <br>
    creates soon after it is born. Echolocation tells the dolphins the shape, size, speed, distance, and location of the object.<br>
    Bottlenose dolphins have a sharp sense of hearing.<br>

<h3>About the Blue Whales!</h3>
<a href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/blue-whale"><h5>Information from National Geographic</h5></a>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/blue-whale">
    The blue whale is the largest mammal in the world.Blue whales are able to breathe air, but they are very comfortable in the<br>
    ocean waters where buoyancy helps to support their incredible bulk. These mammals are found in all the world's oceans and <br>
    often swim insmall groups or alone.Only a few thousand blue whales are believed to swim the world's oceans. They were hunted<br>
    for many years fortheir blubber and oil, and they were almost hunted to extinction. They were protected under the 1966 <br>
    International Whaling Convention and are now considered to be an endangered species.<br>
